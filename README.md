# 50 Days Coding Challenge â€“ VIT Bhopal 

Welcome to my submission repository for the **50 Days Coding Challenge** organized by VIT Bhopal placement cell under the #DrGViswanathanChallenge initiative.

Every day, we solve 1â€“2 problems from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), focusing on topics like Data Structures and Programming Fundamentals. This repository contains my daily solutions in C++.

## ðŸ“„ File Naming Convention

Each file is named using the following format:

DayX_LeetCode_ProblemID.cpp

- `DayX`: Indicates the challenge day (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.)
- `LeetCode_ProblemID`: Refers to the problem number on LeetCode (e.g., `LeetCode_21`)

**Example**:  
`Day1_LeetCode_876.cpp` â†’ Solution for Day 2, LeetCode problem [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
